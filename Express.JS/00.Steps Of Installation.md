# Setting Up Express with Nodemon

This guide walks you through setting up an Express.js project with `nodemon` for automatic server restarts during development.

---

## 📁 Step 1: Initialize the Project

Run the following command to create a `package.json` file:

```bash
npm init -y
```

This will generate a basic `package.json` file like the following:

```json
{
  "name": "expressjs-tutorial",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

## 🚀 Step 2: Install Express

Install Express with:

```bash
npm install express
```

---

## ⚙️ Step 3: Install Nodemon (Dev Dependency)

Install `nodemon` for development use:

```bash
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

---

## 📝 Step 4: Update `scripts` in `package.json`

Add the following line under the `"scripts"` section:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node index.js",
  "dev": "nodemon index.js"
}
```

Now, you can start the server using:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## ✅ Done!

Your Express project is ready with `nodemon` for development. Happy coding!
