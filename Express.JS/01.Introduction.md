# 📘 Express.js Basic Server Setup

This document explains how to set up a simple Express.js project and describes the purpose of each line in the basic server initialization code.

---

## 📦 What is Express.js?

Express.js is a fast, minimal, and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides robust features for building web and mobile applications.

---

## 🛠️ Setting Up the Project

### Install Express.js

```bash
npm init -y            # Initialize a Node.js project
npm install express    # Install Express.js
```

---

## 📄 Example Code Breakdown

```js
import express from "express";
```

* **Purpose:** Imports the Express.js module using ES6 `import` syntax.
* **Note:** If your project uses CommonJS, replace it with:

  ```js
  const express = require("express");
  ```

---

```js
const app = express();
```

* **Purpose:** Initializes a new Express application.
* **Explanation:** The `express()` function returns an instance of an Express application, which can be used to define routes and middleware.

---

```js
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
```

* **Purpose:** Sets the port on which the server will listen.
* **Explanation:**

  * `process.env.PORT`: Reads the port number from environment variables, useful in production environments.
  * `|| 3000`: If no environment variable is provided, defaults to port `3000`.

---

```js
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Running on Port ${PORT}`);
});
```

* **Purpose:** Starts the Express server.
* **Details:**

  * `app.listen(PORT, callback)`: Listens for incoming HTTP requests on the specified port.
  * `console.log(...)`: Logs a confirmation message once the server starts successfully.

---

## Full Example Code

```js
import express from "express";

const app = express();

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Running on Port ${PORT}`);
});
```

---

## 📌 Next Steps

* Define API routes using `app.get()`, `app.post()`, etc.
* Use middleware for handling requests, responses, and errors.
* Deploy your application using services like Heroku, Render, or Vercel.
