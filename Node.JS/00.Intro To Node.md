## REPL in Node.js

REPL stands for **Read-Eval-Print Loop**, and it is an environment in Node.js where you can enter commands, have them evaluated, and see the result immediately. This is especially useful for testing small code snippets, debugging, or learning Node.js interactively.

### What Each Letter Represents

* **R - Read**: The REPL reads the userâ€™s input, parses it into a JavaScript data structure.
* **E - Eval**: The parsed data is evaluated as a JavaScript expression.
* **P - Print**: The result is printed to the console.
* **L - Loop**: It loops back to wait for the next input, unless explicitly exited.

## Creating Your First Node.js Application

Here's a simple Node.js application using the `readline` module to interact with the user via the terminal:

```js
const readline = require('readline');

const rl = readline.createInterface({
    input: process.stdin,
    output: process.stdout
});

// Prompt user for input
rl.question("Please Enter Your Name: ", (name) => {
    console.log("Your name is " + name);
    rl.close();
});

// Handle interface close event
rl.on('close', () => {
    console.log("Interface Closed");
    process.exit(0);
});
```

### Explanation:

* `readline.createInterface()` sets up the input/output interface.
* `rl.question()` prompts the user and receives input.
* `rl.close()` ends the interaction once the input is handled.
* `rl.on('close')` listens for the close event and exits the process gracefully.

This basic program is a good starting point for understanding how Node.js handles user input through the command line.

## Pro Tip:

To enter the REPL environment directly, simply type:

```bash
node
```

Then, you can experiment with JavaScript code interactively.
